Now vampires no longer need to fear the sun! This mod adds umbrellas that protect vampires from the sun.

There are 3 types of umbrellas: Iron, Gold, and Diamond. Each of them has a different durability that can be changed in the configuration file.

And each type of umbrella is available in 16 different colors.
